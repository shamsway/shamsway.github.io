I'd intended to include this in my [review of Network Programability and Automation]({% post_url 2018-03-06-network-automation-book-review %}), but I forgot, and it was long enough anyways.

Over the past few months I've had some conversations with co-workers about backing up configurations from Edge Gateways in vCloud Director. After reading through the first few chapters of the aforementioned book, I decided to put the pieces together and give it a shot. There was some additional Googling required to write this, but a good portion of it comes directly from info I learned from Network Programability and Automation.
