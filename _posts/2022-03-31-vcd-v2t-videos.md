excerpt: Links to two videos I created with my colleage Joesph Polcar on V to T migration for Cloud Director<p>
---

Recently I recorded a couple videos with my teammate, Joseph Polcar, on Cloud Director V to T migration. The first video provides an overview of the migration tool, running and evaluating an assessment, and other steps needed to prepare for a migration. The second video provides an overview of the YAML configuration file used by the migration tool, a walkthrough of what happens during each phase of the migration, and how to perform a rollback. Hopefully you find these videos helpful.
