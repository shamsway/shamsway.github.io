  Welcome to my site. My name is Matt Elliott. I am a Dad, Husband, Geek and Network Engineer/Architect born and raised in Lexington, KY. I've been interested in computers for most of my life. I spent several summers attending the University of Kentucky Childrens Summer Program, where I learned BASIC on their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Computer">Prime</a> system. I was hooked from day one, and spent much of my adolescence reading about any computer-related subject I could get my hands on. Being an avid gamer added more fuel to that fire.
  <p><br>
  Around age thirteen I installed linux for the first time (Slackware IIRC), and I have been a passionate supporter of Linux and Open Source Software ever since. I also lucked out by having a mother on faculty at UK, and she gave over her credentials. This gave me access to several UNIX-based systems, and I dove in head first to newsgroups, IRC, MUDs, and all those other pre-web Internet curiosities. Like most nerdy kids my age, I bought a modem and started calling every BBS in my area code. I even met networking legend <a href="http://smorris.uber-geek.net">Scott Morris</a> and got to see his legendary BBS setup. This was the phase of my life where I was reading <a href="https://www.2600.com">2600</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchist_Cookbook">The Anarchist Cookbook</a>, and I assumed I was on the path to becoming an uber-l33t hacker. That phase passed, but I am still fascinated by DEF CON presentations, and I hope to make it in person one day.

  My first "real" technology job was fixing computers at <a href="http://kytrade.com">Kentucky Trade Computers</a> while attending the University of Kentucky. After receiving my BS in Computer Science, I started doing C# and PHP web development for a local company. It became apparent quickly that they needed someone besides the CEO to run the infrastructure, so I earned my CCNA and MCSE. I realized that I was enamored with networking and I focused my career on becoming a full-fledged Network Engineer. Since then, I have worked in Healthcare, Manufacturing, Big Law, and I am currently a Solutions Architect at a regional <a href="https://www.thinksis.com">CSP/MSP/VAR</a>. I earned my CCIE Data Center in March 2017.

  I've adopted this sticker I found on reddit as a personal logo, and I want to make sure I give credit to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/redskyguy">/u/redskyguy</a> since he is the creator. It's awesome and goofy, and I feel like it sums up the life of a network engineer pretty well. If you like it as much as I do, you can buy the stickers <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/redskyguy/works/21034906-drink-coffee-route-packets?p=sticker">here</a>.

  My hope for this blog is to document some of the interesting problems I've come across, as well as contribute back to the wider community. Thanks for reading.
