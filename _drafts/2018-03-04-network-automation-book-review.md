I was anxious to get my hands on *[Network Programability and Automation](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042082.do)* by Scott Lowe, Jason Edelman, Matt Oswalt as soon as I saw the first announcement that it was being written. Network automation is a subject that I am deeply interested in, so I was excited when the early access edition showed up on Safari Books Online. I was giving a lot of thought to starting this blog when I started reading, and by the time I made it through a few chapters I knew that I wanted a review of this book to be the first "real" post on my blog.

> Disclaimer 1: This review is based off an early access edition of [Network Programability and Automation](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920042082.do) on Safari Books Online. The final version is not available on Safari yet, but based on the Table of Contents at the O'Reilly site for the book, there were some structural differences between the early access and final editions.

> Disclaimer 2: I've never written a book review before. I am somewhat writing this for writing's sake - to build up some writing chops as I ramp up this blog.

I absolutely love this book. If you're a network engineer with any interest in where the industry is going, it is a must read. Automation is a scary topic for a lot of engineers due to the perception that you have to be a programming wizard to do it. *Network Programability and Automation* effectively dispels that myth by providing an easy to follow blueprint, and it doesn't presume any previous programming experience. This book is a fantastic resource for both novices and seasoned programmers. It's worth noting that this book focuses on open source tools like Ansible, Salt and StackStorm. Some of these tools have commercial variants, and there are other closed source options out there if this isn't your cup of tea. For the remainder of this review I'm going to go chapter by chapter to give a taste of what the book covers, as well as some additional useful resources.

**Chapter 1** begins with an overview of current network industry trends: Software Defined Networking, and everything that comes with it. The authors are careful to avoid providing a formal definition of SDN, which is a smart choice. You can ask ten different vendors or engineers what SDN is, and get ten different answers. They do, however, nail down the ecosystem that is driving this software defined trend. The release of the OpenFlow protocol is really the point where SDN started, so the book begins with a brief history and overview of OpenFlow. NFV, VXLAN, virtual switching, APIs, fabrics and whitebox switching are touched on as well. This is a good primer for the engineer that hasn't been keeping up with all of the recent industry hype and hand-waving.

**Chapter 2** provides a high level over view of the what, why and how of network automation. This chapter spells out the benefits of network automation, and typical use cases are covered. We are seeing a shift in the industry away from SNMP and CLIs to APIs and NETCONF, and this is covered as well. It's not mentioned in the book, but VMware NSX is a great example of this. There is no CLI, only API or GUI access for configuration. There is no SNMP polling either - the NSX API is the only way to monitor the environment. Of course, VMware provides commercial tools to monitor NSX, but it's certainly feasible to roll your own monitoring solution once you're familiar with interacting via API.

**Chapter 3** delves in to Linux history, basics, and networking. The early access edition had both a Linux chapter, and an appendix devoted to advanced networking in Linux. I'm assuming that the appendix was rolled into this chapter, which makes perfect sense.

Linux has become the de facto language of the data center, and it is increasingly important that network engineers have an understanding of it. There is a [long list](https://github.com/itdependsnetworks/awesome-network-automation#open-source-projects) of open source projects used for network automation, so the ability to navigate a linux server is table stakes for getting started. The caveat is you could use a commercial network automation product that requires no Linux knowledge, but what fun is that? This chapter is a crucial resource for engineers with no prior Linux experience, and a good refresher for veterans of the operating system.

**Chapter 4** is a Python primer. If Linux is the language of the data center, Python is the language of open source network automation. This chapter explains programming concepts that are foundational for automation â€“ data types, loops, file I/O, and APIs. This chapter goes deep enough into Python to get you started, but there are plenty of additional resources available to further your Python knowledge. The oft-repeated question, "Is coding a requirement for Network Engineers now?" is addressed as well. I'll let you read the book to see how this is answered, and I agree with the answer given in the book.

 If you want to learn more, these are my recommendations.

* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)

The early access edition of this book included an appendix on [NAPALM](https://napalm-automation.net) (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support), a Python library for interacting with network hardware. I do not know if this content was moved to the Python chapter or not, but the NAPALM is mentioned several times in this book and it's widely used by other tools. It's worth your time to read the [docs](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), follow their [blog](https://napalm-automation.net/blog/), and star their [GitHub](https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm) project. It's safe to say that when you're starting out with network automation, you're going to use NAPALM in some way, shape or form.

**Chapter 5** explains data models like JSON, XML, YAML, and YANG. The data models are equated to programming elements introduced in the previous chapter. This is not the most riveting information in the book, but it becomes very important as it is foundational to the tools introduced later in the book, as well as when consuming APIs. I wish there was a little more information about YANG in this chapter, but there are plenty of other resources out there. Once you've read through this book, you can find some great YANG examples at these links:

* https://github.com/YangModels/yang
* https://github.com/openconfig/public

**Chapter 6** is similar to the previous chapter. It introduces the Jinja templating language, which is what you will use to build your configuration templates. This chapter is full of plenty of great examples and advice. Jinja was one thing I had very little understanding of before reading this book, and this flipped on the light switch for me. I believe all of the network automation tools introduced later in the book use Jinja, so it is an important concept to understand.

**Chapter 7** goes into great detail on APIs, both RESTful and non-RESTful, and NETCONF. My takeaway from this chapter that NETCONF is a somewhat more complicated than the other options. Part of this is from having to deal with XML, and more widespread adoption of RESTCONF should ease this a bit. There is a great overview of using the Python `requests` library for interacting with APIs. There are also useful examples using Cisco Nexus NX-API, IOS-XE RESTCONF, Arista EAPI, NETCONF via ncclient, and an intro to the Python `netmiko` library. :+1:
